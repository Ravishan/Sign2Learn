# Dynamic Progress Tracking System

## Overview
The Sign2Learn app now features a fully dynamic progress tracking system that monitors and displays real user learning progress.

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration
- When a user registers, their progress is initialized with:
  - `lettersLearned: 0`
  - `gamesPlayed: 0` 
  - `totalScore: 0`
  - `currentStreak: 0`
  - `lastGameDate: null`

### 2. Game Progress Tracking
- Every time a user completes a game, detailed data is saved to Firebase:
  - **Game History**: Stored in `users/{userId}/games/` subcollection
  - **Game Data**: Includes date, score, time spent, letters completed, game type
  - **User Stats**: Updated in main user document

### 3. Progress Calculation
The system automatically calculates:

#### Letters Learned
- Counts total letters completed across all games
- Each game completion adds `lettersCompleted` to the total

#### Games Played  
- Counts total number of completed games
- Retrieved from `games` subcollection size

#### Total Score
- Sums up scores from all completed games
- Accumulates across multiple game sessions

#### Day Streak
- Calculates consecutive days of game activity
- Based on game completion dates
- Resets if user misses a day

### 4. Achievement System
Achievements are dynamically unlocked based on progress:

- **First Steps**: Learn 5 letters
- **Game Master**: Play 5 games  
- **Perfect Score**: Reach 100 points
- **Streak Master**: 7 day learning streak
- **Letter Master**: Learn 20 letters
- **High Scorer**: Reach 500 total points

### 5. Level Progression
Users progress through levels based on total score:
- Level 1 (Beginner): 0-499 points
- Level 2 (Explorer): 500-999 points  
- Level 3 (Scholar): 1000-1499 points
- Level 4 (Master): 1500-1999 points
- Level 5 (Grand Master): 2000+ points
